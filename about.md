I'm 23 and live in Pune, India. I’ve studied Engineering (Information
Technology) at Pune Institute of Computer Technology, 2013 batch. Never thought
that I’ll actually be proud of it. 

I also maintain a technical blog
*[decached.com](https://decached.com){:target="_blank"}* for all my professional
posts.

Apart from all those boring details, I'm a student of everything I can lay my
hands on. I particularly enjoy Comics, Human Anatomy, Finance and Music. I can
be found playing a Guitar or Drums. Only music can soothe my nerves. 

I’m a terrible poet, but I like expressing. I <s>write</s> used to write on
Quora back when I was in college, but I gave up. I'll be resuming soon, so keep
an eye.

My Saturdays are reserved for my friends and Sundays for family. I love people
who are smart and competitive. Kindness is optional, but boring, aimless and
alcoholics repel me.

You can contact me for anything. Help, favours, coffee, talks, sessions, hangout. I'm ***@decached*** on most services. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/{{ site.alias }}), [Quora](https://quora.com/{{ site.author | slugify }}), [GitHub](https://github.com/{{ site.alias }}) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/{{ site.alias }}), or go old school by emailing me at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
