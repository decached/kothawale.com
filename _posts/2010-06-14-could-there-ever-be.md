No matter how hard you try, you have to trade happiness at times. However, the
more difficult part is when you realize that you aren't able to get it back.
When life hits you hard, taking a step back, regrouping yourself is possibly the
only thing that you can do. Here, I pen down the frustration I went through
during the toughtest times of my life, in the hope of a ray of light.

This is it.

> Could there be a day,  
> when all my sins run away,  
> I fly all directions like a sun ray.
> 
> 
> Could there be a day,   
> when I'll have a second's breath,   
> to cover my sorrows with a knurling wreath.
> 
> 
> Could there be a day,   
> when I'll be free from weeds,   
> the ones which have grown as results of my good deeds.
> 
> 
> Could there be a day,   
> when I stand above all,   
> limit myself and the time I waste to crawl.
> 
> 
> Could there be a day,   
> when our frequencies match all far,   
> it cherishes and heals my scar. 
> 
> 
> Could there be a day,   
> when I'll avail all facilities,   
> the day when I cross all the adamantine walls of difficulties.
